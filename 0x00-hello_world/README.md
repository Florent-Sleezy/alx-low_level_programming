Description
This project is designed to introduce you to the basics of C programming. You will learn about the C preprocessor, compiler, assembler, and various C functions and concepts. The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of C programming.

Project Tasks
Task 0: Preprocessor
Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
Task 1: Compiler
Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link it.
Task 2: Assembler
Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C file and saves it in an output file.
Task 3: Name
Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
Task 4: Hello, puts
Write a C program that prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" using the puts function.
Task 5: Hello, printf
Write a C program that prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," using the printf function.
Task 6: Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation
Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
Task 7: Intel (Advanced)
Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.
Task 8: UNIX is basically a simple operating system (Advanced)
Write a C program that prints a specific quote to the standard error without using printf or puts.
Getting Started
To run these tasks, follow the instructions provided in each task's description. You'll need a C compiler (e.g., gcc) and a Unix-like terminal to execute the scripts and compile the C programs.
