# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

This repository contains solutions to the ALX School low-level programming and algorithm curriculum's project on C functions and nested loops.

## Description

This project is designed to help you practice and understand the following concepts:

- Nested loops
- C functions
- Function prototypes
- Variable scope
- Compilation using `gcc` with specific flags
- Header files and `#include` statements
- Coding style and formatting using Betty style

## Project Tasks

This project consists of several tasks, each of which focuses on a specific concept or programming skill. Here are the tasks included in this project:

1. `_putchar`: Write a program that prints "_putchar," followed by a new line.

2. "I sometimes suffer from insomnia..." - Write a function to print the lowercase alphabet.

3. "10 x alphabet" - Write a function to print the lowercase alphabet 10 times.

4. `islower`: Write a function to check if a character is lowercase.

5. `isalpha`: Write a function to check if a character is alphabetic.

6. `Sign`: Write a function to print the sign of a number (+, 0, or -).

7. `Absolute Value`: Write a function to compute the absolute value of an integer.

8. "I'm federal agent Jack Bauer..." - Write a function to print every minute of the day in the format HH:MM (00:00 to 23:59).

9. "Learn your times table" - Write a function to print the 9 times table.

10. "a + b" - Write a function to add two integers.

11. "98 Battery Street, the OG" - Write a function to print all natural numbers from a given number `n` to 98.

12. "The World looks like a multiplication-table..." - Write a function to print the times table up to a specified value `n`.

13. "Nature made the natural numbers..." - Write a program to compute and print the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.

14. "In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci..." - Write a program to print the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting from 1 and 2.

## Requirements

- The code should be written in C.
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All code files should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All code files should end with a newline.
- A `README.md` file must be present at the root of the project directory.

## Coding Style

- The code should follow the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- No more than 5 functions are allowed per file.
- Global variables are not allowed.
- Standard library functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., are forbidden. You can use `_putchar`.

## Getting Started

To use or test any of the functions, you can compile the code by running the `gcc` command followed by the code file's name and the necessary header files. For example:

```shell
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 _putchar.c 0-putchar.c -o 0-putchar
```

And then run the compiled program:

```shell
./0-putchar
```

This will execute the `_putchar` program and display the output.
