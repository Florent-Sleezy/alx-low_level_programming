# 0x05. C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

**Author:** Julien Barbier

**Project Weight:** 1

This is an ongoing second chance project that started on September 18, 2023, and must be completed by September 20, 2023. An automated quality assurance review will be launched at the deadline.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

**General**
- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables

---

## Copyright - Plagiarism

You are tasked with coming up with solutions for the tasks yourself to meet the above learning objectives. You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else's work. You are not allowed to publish any content of this project. Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

---

## Requirements

**General**
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc... is forbidden
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- You don't have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do, it won't be taken into account
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don't have to push them to your repo (if you do we won't take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the ones shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
- Don't forget to push your header file

**More Info**
- You do not need to learn about pointers to functions, pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, arrays of structures, `malloc` and `free` - yet.

## Tasks

### 0. 98 Battery st.
- Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

Prototype: `void reset_to_98(int *n);`

### 1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream
- Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

Prototype: `void swap_int(int *a, int *b);`

### 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read
- Write a function that returns the length of a string.

Prototype: `int _strlen(char *s);`

### 3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them
- Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

Prototype: `void _puts(char *str);`

### 4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear
- Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

Prototype: `void print_rev(char *s);`

### 5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes
- Write a function that reverses a string.

Prototype: `void rev_string(char *s);`

### 6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true
- Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

Prototype: `void puts2(char *str);`

### 7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half
- Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

Prototype: `void puts_half(char *str);`

### 8. Arrays are not pointers
- Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

Prototype: `void print_array(int *a, int n);`

### 9. strcpy
- Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

Prototype: `char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);`

### 10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers (Advanced)
- Write a function that converts a string to an integer.

Prototype: `int _atoi(char *s);`

### 11. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code (Advanced)
- Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.

You are allowed to use the standard library. You don't have to pass the betty-style tests (you still need to pass the betty-doc tests).
