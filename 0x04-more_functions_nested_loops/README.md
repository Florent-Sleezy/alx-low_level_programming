# 0x04.C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

This repository contains solutions to various C programming tasks designed to help you practice and improve your skills in C programming. These tasks cover topics such as nested loops, functions, conditional statements, and more.

## Learning Objectives
By completing these tasks, you will gain a deeper understanding of the following concepts:

- How to use nested loops effectively.
- How to define and use functions in C.
- The difference between function declarations and definitions.
- The purpose of function prototypes.
- The scope of variables.
- How to use GCC flags like `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-pedantic`, `-Wextra`, and `-std=gnu89`.
- Working with header files and the `#include` directive.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, make sure you have a C development environment set up, preferably on a system running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. You can use editors like vi, vim, or emacs to write your code.

## Repository Structure
The project is organized into different directories, each containing a C file with a specific task. Here are the tasks included in this project:

### Task 0: _isupper
Write a function that checks for an uppercase character.

### Task 1: _isdigit
Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

### Task 2: mul
Write a function that multiplies two integers.

### Task 3: print_numbers
Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

### Task 4: print_most_numbers
Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4.

### Task 5: more_numbers
Write a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 14, ten times, followed by a new line.

### Task 6: print_line
Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

### Task 7: print_diagonal
Write a function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.

### Task 8: print_square
Write a function that prints a square in the terminal.

### Task 9: Fizz-Buzz
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz."

### Task 10: print_triangle
Write a function that prints a triangle in the terminal.

## Usage
Each task has its own main file that you can compile and run to test your code. Make sure to use the provided GCC flags and follow the specific requirements for each task.

For example, to compile and run Task 0:

```shell
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-isupper.c -o 0-isupper
./0-isupper
```

## Important Notes
- Follow the provided coding style (Betty style) for your code.
- Avoid using global variables and the standard library functions unless explicitly allowed in the task description.
- Ensure that your code meets the project's requirements and constraints.
- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
